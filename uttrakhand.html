                About Kasauli Tourism: Situated in the Solan district of Himachal Pradesh, Kasauli is a town and cantonment established in 1842 by the Britishers. It is one of the state’s most visited tourist destinations owing to its pleasant weather, picturesque sites, lush greenery and impressive colonial architecture. Holidify offers you the chance to escape to this little hill station for a getaway with its multitude of Kasauli tour packages.
      
      An excellent way to capture the entire town in a single frame is to hike up to Monkey Point, where you would also find a Hanuman temple. Another breathtaking spot is Sunset Point. Don’t forget to ride the toy train on your trip to Kasauli so that you can admire the views of the surrounding peaks and villages.
      
      Given its hilly terrain, Kasauli has plenty of trails for hiking, trekking and bird watching, like the Gilbert Trail that begins from Kasauli Club and ends at the Air Force Station. You can also spend time in Timber Trail, a small village full of coniferous trees and green mountains. It is accessible via the Timber Trail Ropeway and is dotted with luxurious resorts!
      
      Structures like the Baptist Church, Christ Church and Kasauli Brewery are well-known tourist attractions given that they are a testament to the region’s colonial past. Also, visit the historic Gurkha Fort with various exhibits that the Gurkha Army built against the Britishers. Moreover, you can also visit Sri Baba Balak Nath Temple and Gurudwara Shri Guru Nanak Ji and pay your respects.</p>

                About Rishikesh Tourism: Situated in the foothills of the Himalayas, Rishikesh is a city often called the “Gateway to the Garhwal Himalayas,” renowned for being a major yoga centre all around the globe.

Rishikesh is also known for other ashrams like the Omkarananda Ashram, Andhra Ashram and Madhuban Ashram. Don’t forget to add Ragunath Temple, Tera Manzil Temple and Geeta Bhawan to your itinerary!
      
      A sight to see is the Ram Jhula, a suspension bridge that connects Shivananda Nagar to Swarg Ashram and even the Lakshman Jula connecting Tapovan to Jonk. To experience why Rishikesh is a holy destination, attend the Ganga Aarti held at dusk; it is an unforgettable experience, with the floating diyas, temple bells, and mantras being chanted.
      
      Your trip to Rishikesh mustn't exclude a visit to its gushing waterfalls like the Neer Garh Waterfall and Himshail Waterfalls. What’s more, being a yoga capital, it is known for its yoga and wellness centres like the Anand Prakash Ashram, Himalayan Yog Ashram. Head over to Vashishta Gufa to see where sage Vashishtha, son of Lord Brahma meditated.</p>

                About Jim Corbett National Park Tourism: The oldest national park in the country, Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand, is the home of the endangered Bengal tiger. It is named after Jim Corbett, the naturalist. A must-visit destination for nature enthusiasts, the region’s diverse flora and fauna are quite fascinating.

                Jim Corbett Park spans over 520 km2 and houses approximately 650 species of birds, 488 species of flora, 50 species of mammals and 25 species of reptiles that you can discover through jeep and canter safaris organised in the mornings and evenings. Zones open for safari are Dhikala, Jhirna, Durga Devi, Bijrani and Dhela, where you can spot Bengal tigers, leopards, elephants, Maroon orioles, etc.
                
                When you travel to Jim Corbett National Park, make it a point to visit the gushing Corbett Waterfall, incredible on full-moon nights, where you can swim and set up a picnic. Situated within the Dhikala zone is the famous Dhikala Forest Lodge that attracts crowds wishing to spot the Bengal tiger, Hog deer, spotted deer, etc. There are 32 rooms and a restaurant within the building.

Jim Corbett National Park tour packages also take you to explore the region’s temples like the ancient Sitabani Temple, Durga Mandir and Garjiya Devi Temple.</p>
